### Project Summary

Our project is an exciting word game that can be played in a variety of modes with multiple different players. The goal of the game is to think of as many words as you can from a random list of letters before the timer runs out. If you think of more letters than your opponent(s), you win! You cannot repeat any of these generated letters, and you will be on a timer so be sure to think of words as quickly as you can. You can play in head-to-head mode (one vs. one), battle royale mode (you vs. a multitude of players in one game), or tournament mode (you vs. a multitude of players spanning across five games).
