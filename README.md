### Project Summary

Our project is an exciting word game that can be played in a variety of modes with multiple different players. The goal of the game is to think of as many words as you can from a random list of letters before the timer runs out. If you think of more letters than your opponent(s), you win! You cannot repeat any of these generated letters, and you will be on a timer so be sure to think of words as quickly as you can. You can play in head-to-head mode (one vs. one), battle royale mode (you vs. a multitude of players in one game), or tournament mode (you vs. a multitude of players spanning across five games).


* **Login Screen**

Once you start the game, you will be prompted with a login screen. This game uses accounts in order to keep track of your wins and other statistics. If you already have an account, enter your information and click the enter button. If you do not have an account, click the signup button. Once this button is pressed, you will be prompted to enter your desired username and password. If the username is not already in use and the password has been entered correctly, you will proceed to the main menu.


* **Main Menu and Game Modes**

On the main menu, you have the ability to log out of your account with the "log out" button in the top left. This will redirect you to the sign-in screen. On the left side of the window, you will see your account's stats. These stats will change as you complete your games.

On the right-hand side of the window, you have the option to select the game mode. The game modes available are "head to head" and "battle royale." In head to head, you play one player. In battle royal, you play against a lobby of players. In order to begin a game mode, select its corresponding button and click the green "ready up" button. If your mode is head-to-head, your game will start as soon as another user queues for head-to-head mode. If your mode is battle royal, the game will wait for three players to queue in battle royal mode. Once they do, the lobby will wait for 60 seconds for more players to join, then the game will start.


* **In the Game**

Once you have entered the game, no matter what version, your goal is to enter as many words as you can create from the randomly generated list of letters. This list of letters can be found at the top of the window, and you enter your guesses at the bottom. You will also see your score and a timer in the top right. If your guess is not a valid word, you will see a red flash toward the bottom of the screen. If your guess is valid, you will see a green flash and your guess appear in the middle of the window. This area stores all your guesses so you know what words you've already gotten. Additionally, your score will increase. The scoring method is the same that scrabble uses. Each letter has a point value, and rare letters are worth more. Once the timer ends, you will see the game results screen.


* **Results Screen**

The results screen contains a leaderboard towards the left of the window. This displays the score of every user in the game in order of highest score to lowest. On the right side, you will see your score and rank compared to the other players in the game. Click the main menu button to return to the main menu. Once you do, your stats will be updated to reflect the results of the game.


* **Joining or Creating a Tournament**

Tournaments are unique from battle royale because while both involve playing with multiple players, tournament mode keeps track of your score over a series of five games instead of one. To enter tournament mode, click the tournament mode button in the bottom left corner of the main menu. Once you do, your window will move to the tournament home page. This page has two main options: join a tournament and create a tournament. To join an existing tournament, enter the name of the tournament you'd like to join and click the join tournament button. To see what tournaments you can join, see the list of available tournaments below the join button. If you entered a valid existing tournament, you will join that tournament.

Additionally, you can create your own tournament using the prompt in the top right. Enter the name of your tournament in the text box above the create tournament button, and then click the button. As long as your tournament name is not already in use, your tournament will begin. Lastly, if you don't want either of these options, you can click the main menu button.


* **Tournament Preview**

Once you've joined or created a tournament, you will see a screen containing a leaderboard for the tournament. This leaderboard shows the top player in the tournament ranked by their tournament wins. This leaderboard is updated as the tournament progresses. You will also see your stats in the bottom left. You can exit to the main menu with the main menu button, or you can press the ready-up button. Once another player in the tournament ready up, the two of you will be put in a one vs one game together.
